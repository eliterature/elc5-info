If you have question about the call, the submissions process, or the collection in general, please check our FAQ below, or feel free to [contact the editors](mailto:elcvol5@gmail.com) with any additional questions.

## Can I submit multiple things to help my chances of being accepted?

You should submit your best work. Submitting more than one work does not increase your chances. **Please do not submit more than three times for a single author or the same group of authors.** Generally, we will accept one single author and one multi-author work of the same group of authors.

## Can I submit a repository or collection of works?

We are open to this! Please contact us to start the conversation at <elcvol5@gmail.com>.

## Can I submit short text-based works?

While not every work needs to be multimedia or interactive, text-based works should be shaped by their digital nature whether they exist purely on screens, in hybrid formats, in print, or in physical spaces.

## Can I submit a conversation with a generative AI?

We welcome works that use such technologies in order to defamiliarize hegemonic AI models and platforms through critical and creative engagement. Works using such technologies should prioritize transparency, deliberation, and accountability in terms of specific datasets, models, and environmental impacts whenever possible and relevant. Authorial statements should be explicit in acknowledging their use and the work’s aesthetic rationales.

## Can I submit a literary NFT?

We welcome works that use such technologies in order to defamiliarize hegemonic crypto models and platforms through critical and creative engagement. Works using such technologies should prioritize transparency, deliberation, and accountability in terms of specific datasets, models, and environmental impacts whenever possible and relevant. Authorial statements should be explicit in acknowledging their use and the work’s aesthetic rationales.

## Do you offer compensation for submissions accepted?

Unfortunately, we cannot offer compensation. The ELC5 team is a collection of volunteers working with the larger Electronic Literature Organization, which is a 501c(3) non-profit organization.
